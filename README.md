# C++ Learning Repository

This repository contains my practical work and experiments while studying **C++** using the following learning resources:

## Courses
- **Cisco C++ Essentials 1**
- **Cisco C++ Essentials 2**
- **Cisco C++ Essentials 3**

## Additional Learning Materials
- [C++ A complete and modern course for beginners by Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpfHmAkRVK4)

## Repository Structure
Each course or topic is organised into its own directory.  
Every directory represents a **self-contained examples or lesson** and typically includes its own `main.cpp`.
